## Controls

### lr-fuse

lr-fuse utilises Retroarch configurations

Add custom retroarch controls to the retroarch.cfg file in
```shell
/opt/retropie/configs/zxspectrum/retroarch.cfg
```
For more information on custom RetroArch controls see: [RetroArch Configuration](RetroArch-Configuration)

By default, 

* Buttons A, X and Y are mapped to the joystick's fire button, and button B is mapped to the UP directional button. 
* Buttons L1 and R1 are mapped to RETURN and SPACE, respectively. 
* The SELECT button brings up the embedded, on-screen keyboard.

If you are using more than one joystick, then it is worth reading the [official documentation](https://github.com/libretro/fuse-libretro#input-devices) at lr-fuse Github page.

The default joystick emulated by lr-fuse is the Cursor joystick. If you wish to set Kempston as your default, then add the following line to the file `/opt/retropie/configs/all/zxspectrum/retroarch.cfg`:

    input_libretro_device_p1 = "513"

### Running a 48K Machine

Some ZX Spectrum games require a 16K machine (e.g. Deathchase) or will run only on a 48K machine, for example, titles from Ultimate Play The Game such as Atic Atac and Jetpac.

By default, lr-fuse emulates the 128K machine but it is possible to emulate a given ROM in a 48K machine via loading the ROM, changing the **Core Option** per-ROM for **Model (needs Content file)** to **48k** (see [Setting Core Options per-ROM](RetroArch-Core-Options#setting-core-options-per-rom)), then exiting and re-loading the ROM. 

### Joypad to Keyboard Mapping
Thanks to forum member @pjft's [contribution](https://retropie.org.uk/forum/topic/16753/lr-fuse-joypad-to-keyboard-mapping) to lr-fuse, it is possible to play ZX Spectrum games without a need for a keyboard. This is useful for games that don't support joysticks such as Chuckie Egg and for games that require keyboard input in addition to a joystick (e.g. Head Over Heels).

1. Launch a game you wish to map a joypad to a keyboard.
2. Launch the RGUI by pressing hotkey+X and navigate to `Quick menu` -> `Options`. In the menu, assign a key to joypad buttons `Joypad Left mapping`, `Joypad Right mapping` etc. as required. Below is an example for Chuckie Egg.

3. Exit the RGUI and test in-game if necessary.
4. To save, return to `Quick menu` -> `Options` in the RGUI and select `Game-options file`. This will save the mappings to a game specific options file.
