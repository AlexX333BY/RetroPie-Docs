## Emulator: [Quasi88](https://www.eonet.ne.jp/~showtime/quasi88/)
Note that the emulator (and most documentation) is written in Japanese, so it may be nearly impossible to configure the emulator without translating each option by hand, or by doing some guesswork.

## Controls
By default, Quasi88 uses the keyboard for controls.  To enable a controller:

```
Press F12.  This will bring up a menu with several tabs at the top.
Click the "マウス" tab. (7th from the left, roughly translates to "mouse") 
Click the dropdown that's labelled "nomouse". Change it to "joystick".
```

Once this is done, the controls will be automatically mapped as such:
```
Left Joystick - Number Pad
A Button - Z key
B button - X key
```
## Emulator Translations

From left to right, these are all the tabs on the top of the Quasi88 menu:
```
Reset, CPU, Video, Volume, Disk, Keyboard, Mouse, Tape, Miscellaneous, About Quasi88
```

These are the buttons on the bottom of the menu, from left to right:
```
Status (F11), Save Configuration, Quit Emulator (F12), Exit Menu (Esc)
```
