## Emulator: [Quasi88](https://www.eonet.ne.jp/~showtime/quasi88/)
Note that, since the PC-8801 was almost exclusively a Japanese machine, the emulator (and most documentation) is also in Japanese, so it may be nearly impossible to configure the emulator without translating each option by hand.

## Controls
By default, Quasi88 uses the keyboard for controls.  To allow a joystick:

```
Press F12.  This will bring up a menu, where you can adjust various things like PC model and clockspeed.
Click the "マウス" tab. (7th from the left, roughly translates to "mouse") 
Click the dropdown that's labelled "nomouse" and change it to "joystick".
```

Once this is done, the controls will be automatically mapped as such:
```
Left Joystick - Number Pad
A Button - Z key
B button - X key
```
