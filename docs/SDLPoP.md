_SDLPoP is an open source port of the classic game [Prince of Persia](https://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/prince-of-persia)._

#### Cheats
_Note: Cheats only work if you start the game with the command line option: "megahit"_

- Shift-T: Give more hit-points. (Like a big red potion.)

A nice way to start it from the menu is to make a new .sh file for it, so you can decide if you
like starting it with cheats or without. Simply make an new `prince_with_cheats.sh` file in the folder
`/home/pi/RetroPie/roms/ports` and let it change the directory to: `/opt/retropie/ports/sdlpop`
before starting the game with `./prince megahit`

#### Troubleshooting / Tweaking / Saving the game

You can change the in-game behavior of this game in the following way:

Go to the folder: `/opt/retropie/configs/ports/sdlpop`

There should be an file called `SDLPoP.ini`. If not, copy the file `SDLPoP.ini.def`
over it. When you open this file you can edit some of the configurations of the game,
like from which level onward you are allowed to save the game (default = 3).
There are many other tweaks possible, the file will explain itself.
