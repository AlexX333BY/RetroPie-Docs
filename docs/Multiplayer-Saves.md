Want to play a local multiplayer game but don't want to unlock all the levels, characters, etc.? 
Want to play as Tofu in Resident Evil 2? 
Want to play as Ness vs Captain Falcon vs Luigi vs Jigglypuff on Mushroom Kingdom in Super Smash Bros. (N64) without spending countless hours unlocking EVERYTHING?

[You can download these pre-made game saves so you can experience the full local multiplayer/retro experience! ](https://github.com/madmodder123/retropie_saves)

I went through the headache of using cheats or finding save games on the internet and started this Github page for people to obtain them from.
Most of the saves are for RetroArch emulators but there are also saves for other emulators.

You just need to throw the saves in your "roms" folder and make sure the games are named the same as your ROMs or the saves won't load.

Please contribute if you have any saves that are missing.
