Want to play a local multiplayer game but don't want to unlock all the levels, characters, etc.? 
Want to play as Tofu in Resident Evil 2? 

[You can download these pre-made game saves so you can experience the full local multiplayer/retro experience! ](https://github.com/madmodder123/retropie_saves)

I went through the headache of using cheats or finding save games on the internet and started this Github page for people to obtain them from.

You just need to throw the saves in your "roms" folder and make sure the games are named the same as your ROMs or the saves won't load.

Please contribute if you have any saves that are missing.
