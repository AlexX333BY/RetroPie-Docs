The touchscreen only works in games that allow mice input. See the retropie docs on trackpads for more info on how to setup a mouse in emulators

Troubleshooting:
The touchscreen is not responding
    Change the mouse index one digit higher, if it still isnâ€™t working keep going up. (you can also try 1)
