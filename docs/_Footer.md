I follow this advice and the output from is as follows:
Driver event, mouses 1
mouse 0 '13ba_0018', axes 4, buttons 5
	axe 0 [x]
	axe 1 [y]
	axe 2 [wheel]
	axe 3 [hwheel]
	button 0 [left]
	button 1 [right]
	button 2 [middle]
	button 3 [side]
	button 4 [extra]

It seems everything okay. But when I try to control the game game Golden T 2K as an example, my Trackball doesn't work. But If I connect a regular mouse then it works. Any suggestions?
